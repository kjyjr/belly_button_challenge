# belly_button_challenge

In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site, one that catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Using the D3 library, a JSON file was read in from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

Subsequently, a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu was made to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, then a bubble chart was produced to display each sample.

In addition, displays were also made of the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information, and each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.

Finally, the app was deployed to a free static page hosting service.
